# Front End Technical Test

Welcome to the Touch front end technical test. The purpose of this test is to get an example of what you consider good quality,
well-structured code. Focus first on the areas you consider to be most valuable - and feel free to play to your strengths.

Your challenge is to build an interface which allows you to:

- View each client's portfolio, with the ability to view the assets they have invested in
- View each asset, with the ability to view the clients who have invested in them

For the purpose of this test, there is no backend service to integrate with. You are free to structure the data for your
application, choose how to store or retrieve it and make considerations for integrating with a remote service in the future.

You may also add any other functionality you deem appropriate.

## What we want to see

- A `Vue.js` based front end, ideally taking advantage of `TypeScript`.
- A demo of your solution and walk-through of your code, explaining your decisions and trade-offs.

You are free to use any other technologies or libraries that you'd like.
